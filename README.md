# Dex: A Pokedex App
<br>
This is a web app using the PokeDex API (https://pokedevs.gitbook.io/pokedex/) to create a version of the pokedex from the popular game and television series "Pokemon". 
The purpose of this app is to practice and hone the use of the various technologies, languages, libraries, and frameworks used. As I learn more, I intend to update this app
accordingly if it were to be to the app's benefit and would also continue my learning and practice.
